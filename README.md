Hi there, my name is Marc Stern. I am a graduate student at Montclair State University majoring in Data Science, anticipating graduation in Summer 2022. 
I am a musician, music producer, and audio engineer transitioning into the world of data science. 
I became interested in data science through the scope of being a musician by following the viable data for musicians through mediums like SoundCloud and Spotify 
for Artists. It's both fun and fascinating to keep track of streaming statistics to learn more about the success of my music on various platforms, and to learn
about the people who are listening to my music.
I am highly interested in music-related data science, and I have been interning with Secret Chord Labs to help develop their music-analysis software.
My next step is to begin learning the basics of audio DSP so I can contribute more to world of audio production.
